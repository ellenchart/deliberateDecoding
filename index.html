    <tt></tt>
    <p> This summer, I was an intern at a <a
            href="https://ellenchart.github.io/deliberateDecoding.github.io/#keep">local
            startup</font></a> company.

        <a href="https://ellenchart.github.io/deliberateDecoding.github.io/#keep">
            The co-founders championed our exploration of every intersection of the business, from the complex steps of
            supply chain management to the deliverance within UI/UX design. </font></a> As I delved deeper, I found
        myself entangled in the quest to optimize user experience<a
            href="https://ellenchart.github.io/deliberateDecoding.github.io/#keep">&#8212a maze of questions and
            revelations. What do users seek? How do I manifest that? Why do we stumble through
            winding paths to simply delete an account on an app?
        </a>
    </p>

    <p>Building a full-stack app felt like sculpting with code<a
            href="https://ellenchart.github.io/deliberateDecoding.github.io/#keep">,
            shaping an experience that transcended mere functionality. </a> I decided to enroll in a digital <a
            href="https://ellenchart.github.io/deliberateDecoding.github.io/#keep">
            arts </font></a> journal class the following semester, aspiring to improve my repertoire as a UX/UI
        designer. <a href="https://ellenchart.github.io/deliberateDecoding.github.io/#keep"> But within this class,
            </font></a>I encountered a world <a
            href="https://ellenchart.github.io/deliberateDecoding.github.io/#keep">alien to my
            expectations&#8212Google Maps screenshots dissected, hyperlink art </font></a> that demanded <a
            href="https://ellenchart.github.io/deliberateDecoding.github.io/#keep"> aimless </font></a> personal
        navigation<a href="https://ellenchart.github.io/deliberateDecoding.github.io/#keep">, </font></a>and <a
            href="https://ellenchart.github.io/deliberateDecoding.github.io/#keep">videos
            referencing the digital world I wasn&#146t alive to experience.
    </p>

    <p> <a href="https://ellenchart.github.io/deliberateDecoding.github.io/#keep">Initially, I resisted the </font>
        </a>complexity <a href="https://ellenchart.github.io/deliberateDecoding.github.io/#keep">, questioning the
            need to laboriously convey a message. </font>
        </a>I continued to scroll on Instagram feeling the instant gratification <a
            href="https://ellenchart.github.io/deliberateDecoding.github.io/#keep"> and the array of art
            that
            didn&#146t require me to understand why </font>
        </a>I liked it. <a href="https://ellenchart.github.io/deliberateDecoding.github.io/#keep">As time went on in the
            classroom, I began to understand the importance of complexity in a time when everything is often given to us
            on a silver platter.
        </a>
    </p>

    <p> My <a href="https://ellenchart.github.io/deliberateDecoding.github.io/#keep">summer </font>
        </a>narrative focused on efficiency and creation <a
            href="https://ellenchart.github.io/deliberateDecoding.github.io/#keep">but collided with the subtlety of
            digital art. </font></a>It <a href="https://ellenchart.github.io/deliberateDecoding.github.io/#keep"> posed
            a question that lingered: what does 'better' truly mean? Is it in the transformation of the digital sphere
            within corporate confines or in the rebellion that defies these very structures? The dichotomy </font>
        </a>persists, leaving me <a href="https://ellenchart.github.io/deliberateDecoding.github.io/#keep">with choices,
            </font></a>seeking a path <a href="https://ellenchart.github.io/deliberateDecoding.github.io/#keep">that
            reconciles these contrasting ideals. and the rebellious essence of digital art, often at odds </font>
        </a>with the corporate narrative.

        </a>
    </p>

    <p> <a href="https://ellenchart.github.io/deliberateDecoding.github.io/#keep">An internship at a local startup
            unmasked the intricate layers of app development, from logistics to user
            experience. But </font></a> it was within a digital <a
            href="https://ellenchart.github.io/deliberateDecoding.github.io/#keep"> arts </font></a> class <a
            href="https://ellenchart.github.io/deliberateDecoding.github.io/#keep"> that </font></a> my perceptions were
        <a href="https://ellenchart.github.io/deliberateDecoding.github.io/#keep"> shattered. The intricacies of digital
            art, a realm demanding meticulous attention and </font></a> deliberate <a
            href="https://ellenchart.github.io/deliberateDecoding.github.io/#keep"> decoding, clashed </font></a> with
        my pursuit of streamlined functionality.
    </p>

    <p> <a href="https://ellenchart.github.io/deliberateDecoding.github.io/#keep">The clash of ideals left me torn.
            </font></a>The corporate world beckons with promises of impact<a
            href="https://ellenchart.github.io/deliberateDecoding.github.io/#keep">, yet it often uses users as
            pawns in the game of consumerism. Conversely, I’ve been able to explore digital art that rebels against this
            norm, </font></a> urging a deliberate pace<a
            href="https://ellenchart.github.io/deliberateDecoding.github.io/#keep">, challenging </font></a>
        conventional understanding<a href="https://ellenchart.github.io/deliberateDecoding.github.io/#keep">, and
            </font></a>advocating for <a href="https://ellenchart.github.io/deliberateDecoding.github.io/#keep">depth
            over instant gratification. However, it’s important to note the range of possibilities within digital art,
            from its potential to offer depth and innovation to the pitfalls of succumbing to trends or gimmicks. I’m
            left with more questions than I came in with but I believe I am left with </font></a> a spectrum of
        possibilities <a href="https://ellenchart.github.io/deliberateDecoding.github.io/#keep"></a> to understand from
        instant gratification to deliberate exploration.
