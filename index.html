    <p> This summer, I was an intern at a <a

            startup</font></a> company.

        <a

            The co-founders championed our exploration of every intersection of the business, from the complex steps of
            supply chain management to the deliverance within UI/UX design. </font></a> As I delved deeper, I found
        myself entangled in the quest to optimize user experience <a
            href="https://webenact.rhizome.org/keeping-up-appearances/20151029152713/http://blacknetart.com/keepingupappearances.html#keep">&#8212
            a maze of questions and revelations. What do users seek? How do I manifest that? Why do we stumble through
            winding paths to simply delete an account on an app?
        </a>
    <p>
    <p>Building a full-stack app felt like sculpting with code<a
            href="https://webenact.rhizome.org/keeping-up-appearances/20151029152713/http://blacknetart.com/keepingupappearances.html#family">,
            shaping an experience that transcended mere functionality. </a> I decided to enroll in a digital <a

            arts

            <p>so anyway, <a
                    href="https://webenact.rhizome.org/keeping-up-appearances/20151029152713/http://blacknetart.com/keepingupappearances.html#family">(it’s
                    best not to dwell on white people’s miscalculations in public, even in
                    invisible parentheticals) </a>he showed me the ropes at work. he was a
                mentor to me. <a
                    href="https://webenact.rhizome.org/keeping-up-appearances/20151029152713/http://blacknetart.com/keepingupappearances.html#family">the
                    only thing was, showing me the ropes often meant we had to be off somewhere
                    alone together. the strangest things would happen in these moments, the
                    first of which was when he reached inside my blouse to adjust my bra strap.
                    he walked away, leaving me standing in the middle of the office floor,
                    thinking about the two separate occasions in which a male had, without
                    invitation, reached for my bra. the first time, the other kid and i were
                    both around twelve years old. it was a little strange, but i was okay with
                    it. he was a friend. this time, it felt creepy. on the one hand, there
                    was the age difference. this guy was at least twenty years older than me.
                </a>on the other hand, he was a peer.

                        href="https://webenact.rhizome.org/keeping-up-appearances/20151029152713/http://blacknetart.com/keepingupappearances.html#maybe">i
                        was,
                        after all, eighteen. an adult now.</a> maybe it’s just like that when you’re
                    an adult.

                <p><a
                        href="https://webenact.rhizome.org/keeping-up-appearances/20151029152713/http://blacknetart.com/keepingupappearances.html#maybe">but
                        then he turned around and came towards me: “oh, don’t think anything of
                        that,” he said. “i have a wife and kid, i would never . . .” i don’t remember
                        whether he let it trail off like that or i just stopped listening.</a>

                <p>i never said anything to him about this. <a
                        href="https://webenact.rhizome.org/keeping-up-appearances/20151029152713/http://blacknetart.com/keepingupappearances.html#maybe">but
                        of course i thought something of it. standing there, head pounding. there
                        was the attempt to pull my thoughts together. looking at the faces of people
                        now walking by or moving around in nearby rooms. busy in their cubicles.
                        busy in the copy room. there was the desire to keep this from happening
                        again, but bigger than that was the desire for this to be nothing.</a>

                <p>this <a
                        href="https://webenact.rhizome.org/keeping-up-appearances/20151029152713/http://blacknetart.com/keepingupappearances.html#maybe">
                        is a series of things i told myself i had forgotten:
                        there</a> was <a
                        href="https://webenact.rhizome.org/keeping-up-appearances/20151029152713/http://blacknetart.com/keepingupappearances.html#maybe">
                        the
                        chance he really meant nothing by it, wasn’t there?
                        and if i just made sure my bra strap didn’t show
                        again, there would be
                        nothing to question, right? i could tell him about my
                        discomfort and he
                        could get better (and keep explaining how he meant
                        nothing by it) or get
                        worse. or i could act like it was nothing and things
                        could get better (because
                        nothing had happened) or get worse. worst case
                        scenario: i could say stop
                        and he could show himself to be as evil as i feared
                        him to be. best case
                        scenario: i could say nothing and nothing (else) would
                        happen. i was an
                        optimist.</a>

                        he did these things only in their presence. how their lips pursed, the
                        wheeze of air escaping through their nostrils. the desire to accept </a>friendship.

                        it feels like. the thing. all this had to be worked out in silence, in
                        the head. words, you see, betray themselves.) but maybe you don’t know
                        how things can look better as they are getting worse.</a>

                <p>he praised my work <a

                        wanted things to be right and so, between wrong touches and wrong words,
                        i held my breath. simultaneously added up every undesirable act and erased
                        it from my short term memory. optimism has a way of dimming when you look
                        some people directly in the eye. the longer things went on like this, the
                        more important it became to keep up appearances. if you were to look in
                        on us, at a meeting or in his office, you would often see us laughing together.
                        <i>somehow,</i> i kept thinking, <i>i’m going to get out of here before i feel
                            forced to confront him. if this is happening because he wants to hurt me,
                            i don’t want to know.</i> he became smarmy. i became small. something i
                        still wonder: how small could i have gotten before i felt forced to confront
                        him?</a>

                <p>he praised me and praised me. <a
                        href="https://webenact.rhizome.org/keeping-up-appearances/20151029152713/http://blacknetart.com/keepingupappearances.html#already">i

                        he kept saying, any vices. he held me up against his step-daughter, who
                        was unwed and a new mother, my age. her baby was much lighter than she
                        was. when she came to visit the office, he insulted her the entire time.
                        after each insult, she would smile a resigned smile, shrug, and look to
                        me . . .</a>
